C library for Source Extraction and Photometry

*"... [it's] an SEP: Somebody Else's Problem."  
"Oh, good. I can relax then."*

[Source Extractor](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) is
great, but sometimes you just want to use some of the pieces from it
without running the entire executable. This library is an attempt to
implement a few of the algorithms used in SExtractor in a more modular
way.

As Source Extractor's license is GPLv3 and this is a derived work (though
heavily modified) the license for SEP is also GPLv3.
